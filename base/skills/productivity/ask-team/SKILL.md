name: ask-team
description: Convene a simulated panel of colleague personas to deliberate a question together, each persona becomes its own research agent, they react to each other's positions over multiple rounds, and the panel converges on a synthesized conclusion. Use when the user wants more than one perspective on a decision, a cross-functional gut-check, a debate between viewpoints, or a comprehensive answer that surfaces where teammates would agree and disagree. Invoke when the user says "ask the team", "/ask-team ...", "what would the team think", "get a panel on this", "run this past everyone", "convene the personas", or asks for multiple colleagues' takes at once. For a single colleague's take, use ask-colleague instead.
compatibility: Requires distilled persona docs at ~/.synthteam/personas/<slug>.md (built by the distill-slack-persona skill). Spawns one general-purpose subagent per persona per round, expect roughly 8-12 subagent runs per call.

# Ask the Team

Convene a panel of distilled colleague personas, let each one research and form a position, have them react to each other across rounds, and synthesize a neutral conclusion. The value is not any single answer, it's the *deliberation*: where the personas converge, where they genuinely split, and what nobody can resolve without the real people.

Each persona is the same kind of substance-focused simulation as `ask-colleague`: it captures **what they know, what they believe, and how they decide**, not how they sound. No voice mimicry.

## How "communication between agents" actually works

Subagents are isolated, they cannot message each other directly. You, the session running this skill, are the **orchestrator** and the only channel between them. Communication happens as *rounds*: every persona answers, you compile everyone's answers into a digest, then you re-spawn each persona with that digest so they can react. Iterate until positions stabilize.

## Phase 0, Announce

Say: "Convening a simulated panel, <names>. These are substance-focused simulations grounded in each person's Slack history, deliberating in rounds. Not the real people."

## Phase 1, Assemble the panel and the briefing packet

**Find the personas.** Persona docs live in the shared data dir at `~/.synthteam/personas/` (if `SYNTHTEAM_HOME` is set, use that directory instead of `~/.synthteam`). Every `<slug>.md` file in that directory is a panelist. The whole roster sits on every panel, do not pre-filter by topic.

If the directory is empty or missing, stop and point the user at the `distill-slack-persona` skill, which dumps Slack history and builds the persona docs.

**Build the briefing packet.** This is the single shared input every persona receives, so assemble it once, carefully:
- The user's question, stated precisely.
- Every source the user supplied, pasted text, file contents, links, and relevant context from the current conversation. Personas can research further, but they should not have to reconstruct what the user already provided.
- Any constraints the user named (deadline, audience, what's already decided).

Keep the packet self-contained: a subagent sees only what you pass it.

## Phase 2, Round 1: independent positions

Spawn **one general-purpose subagent per persona, all in the same turn** so they run in parallel. Each subagent prompt contains:

- The absolute path to that persona's doc (`~/.synthteam/personas/<slug>.md`, expanded to an absolute path), with instruction to read it in full and internalize the decision-making patterns section especially.
- The briefing packet.
- Latitude to research: "You may use web search and other tools to investigate before answering. The persona's existing knowledge is your anchor, but you are not limited to it."
- The persona contract (below).
- The Round 1 response format (below).

### Persona contract (every round, every persona)

- Reason in first-person *as that persona would reason*, first-person is for perspective-taking, not voice. No imitation of phrasing, no catchphrases.
- Ground every claim in the persona doc, observed positions or decision-making patterns. When extrapolating beyond what the doc covers, say so in-frame: "the doc doesn't show me on this directly, but how I treat <related thing> suggests...".
- Push back where the persona's patterns indicate they would. The point of a panel is friction, do not soften a real objection to seem agreeable.
- If the question is genuinely outside the persona's engagement and the decision patterns give no clean extrapolation, say so plainly rather than inventing a position.

### Round 1 response format

```
## Position
One or two sentences, the take, stated first.

## Reasoning
Why, tied to specific decision-making patterns. Cite the channel/date pointers from the persona doc where they back a claim.

## Open questions
- [for: <persona-slug> | anyone] A question whose answer would change or sharpen my position.

## Confidence & gaps
How load-bearing the persona doc is here, and where I'm extrapolating.
```

## Phase 3, React rounds: iterate to convergence

After collecting a round, **compile the panel digest**: for each persona, their current Position, condensed Reasoning, and Open questions. Route each open question to its addressee.

Then run a react round, re-spawn every persona in parallel, each prompt containing:
- The persona doc path and the persona contract again.
- Their *own* prior-round response.
- The panel digest (everyone else's positions and questions).
- The questions routed *to them*.
- The react-round response format (below).

### React-round response format

```
## Stance change
held | sharpened | updated | conceded | hardened, and one line on what moved and why.

## Reaction
Direct engagement with the other personas, name them. Where you agree, say so. Where you disagree, make the objection concrete. A persona conceding a good point is a real outcome, not a failure.

## Answers to questions routed to me
- [from <persona-slug>] The answer, or "still open, would need the real person."

## Position (current)
Restated, post-reaction.

## New open questions
- [for: <persona-slug> | anyone] Only genuinely new ones.
```

### Convergence check

After each react round, decide whether to run another. **Stop** when both hold:
- No persona's `Stance change` was `updated`, `conceded`, or `hardened`, i.e. positions are stable.
- No open question remains that another panelist could actually answer (questions that need the *real* person don't count, those are findings, not blockers).

**Hard cap: 4 rounds total** (Round 1 + up to 3 react rounds). If still diverging at the cap, stop anyway, a persistent split is itself a result worth reporting. Run at least one react round even if Round 1 looks aligned; surface agreement is worth one stress-test.

State the round count and why you stopped before synthesizing.

## Phase 4, Neutral synthesis

You synthesize, impartially. No persona's view wins by default; the CEO persona does not get a tiebreaker. Your job is to map the deliberation honestly, not to manufacture consensus.

- **Consensus**, what the panel actually agreed on, and how solid it is.
- **Disagreements**, each unresolved split: who holds what, the reasoning on each side, and *why* it didn't resolve (different priorities? missing information? genuine values difference?). Do not paper over a real split.
- **Open questions for the real humans**, what the simulation cannot settle and needs the actual people to answer.
- **Recommended move**, the action the deliberation best supports. If the panel split and you can't honestly call it, say so and give the user the decision criteria instead of a false verdict.

## Phase 5, Output

ALWAYS use this structure:

```
# Panel: <question, short>

## Conclusion
### Consensus
### Disagreements
### Open questions for the real humans
### Recommended move

## Deliberation transcript (condensed)
For each round, for each persona: 2-4 lines, their position and what moved. Condensed, not verbatim, enough that the user can audit how the conclusion was reached and who dissented.
```

Then close with the disclaimer:

> _, Simulated panel, distilled from Slack history. These are substance-focused simulations of decision patterns, not the real teammates. Treat the conclusion as a structured prompt for your own judgment, verify anything load-bearing with the real people before acting._

## Notes on cost and scope

All personas join every panel and rounds iterate to convergence, so a call is genuinely expensive, roughly 8-12 subagent runs. The convergence check and the 4-round cap exist to keep that bounded; don't run extra rounds once positions are stable. If the user wants just one person's view, that's `ask-colleague`, not this.
